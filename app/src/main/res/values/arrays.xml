            The Face API finds human faces in photos, videos, or live streams.
            It also finds and tracks positions of facial landmarks such as the eyes, nose, and mouth.
            The API also provides information about the state of facial features are the subject\'s
            eyes open? Are they smiling? With these technologies, you can edit photos and video,
            enhance video feeds with effects and decorations, create hands-free controls for games
            and apps, or react when a person winks or smiles.

            An app that uses the camera to track faces and superimpose Googly Eyes animated graphics
            over the eyes. The app also detects whether the eyes are open or closed, drawing the
            eyes in the correct state.

            This sample demonstrates how to use an accelerometer sensor as input for a physics-based
            view. The input from the accelerometer is used to simulate a virtual surface, and a
            number of free-moving objects placed on top of it. Any effects from the device\'s
            acceleration vector (including both gravity and temporary movement) will be translated
            to the on-screen particles.
